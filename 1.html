      <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
      <p> Australia has a first-class quality of education, the country has 38 universities and more than 230 technical colleges. These universities and technical colleges are almost all government public schools (except three private universities), their education system is governed by the state government, so the administrative system is slightly different from state to state, but basically the quality of education is controlled by the Australian federal Government, so each school can maintain an average but high quality of education. The diplomas of each school are mutually recognized by the states and adopted throughout the country. Australia's academic qualifications are widely recognized by all countries in the world, including our country.</p> <br>
